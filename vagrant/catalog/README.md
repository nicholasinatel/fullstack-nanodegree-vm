## Dependencies
Install the following softwares
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) - Install the platform package for your operating system. There is no need for installing the extension pack or the SDK. Do not launch Virtual Box, the Vagrant software will run it.
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) - Download the version of your operating system.

After downloading the softwareâ€™s, git clone the virtual machine configuration at your work station:
- [catalog](https://github.com/nicholasinatel/fullstack-nanodegree-vm/) - This will give you a folder, containing the VM files.


## Configuration
1 - **Start the virtual machine** by going to the cloned folder and executing `vagrant up` inside the vagrant directory, once the command finishes running, type `vagrant ssh`

2 - **Inside the vagrant environment**, run `cd /vagrant/catalog` for the shared folder with access to the Virtual Machine, your current OS and the project files.

In case of problems do step 3.

3 - Delete the file `catalog.db` and execute `python populateDb.py`.


# Run

1- Execute `python application.py`. If everything is fine, than go to `localhost:5000/`, you should see the initial screen of the web app. If you dont execute the step 3 at configuration and than try this procedure again.
